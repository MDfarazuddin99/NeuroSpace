              During Dr. Priyanka Sangani's training period in neurology, she
              developed a special interest in movement disorders, including
              Parkinson's disease, dystonias, and NBIA. These challenging
              disorders have become a focal point of her practice. She has
              presented case reports at state and national level conferences and
              completed a thesis on the clinical spectrum of dementia at a
              tertiary care center. After finishing her superspecialization in
              neurology, Dr. Priyanka Sangani worked as a Consultant
              Neurophysician at Renova Hospitals and began teaching clinical
              classes in neurology for postgraduate (General Medicine) students
              at Princess Durrushevar Hospital. Since April 2021, Dr. Priyanka
              Sangani has been working part-time at American Brain and Spine
              Hospitals, where she has learned the uses of rTMS in stroke and
              its benefits in various neurological and psychiatric illnesses.
              Her passion for neurology has only grown, with a special interest
              in rTMS and other non-invasive treatment modalities for diseases
              with limited medical management options.
